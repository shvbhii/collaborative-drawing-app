## üöÄ About This Project

This project is **Day 19** of my **#30DaysOfVibeCoding** challenge.

The "vibe" for this project was to explore the complexities of real-time communication and build something truly interactive. The goal was to move beyond simple data fetching and create a dynamic, shared experience using WebSockets. This isn't just a static webpage; it's a live environment where users can create together, from any device.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Strokes appear on everyone's screen instantly using WebSockets.
-   **Room-Based Sessions:** Create or join private rooms for isolated drawing sessions.
-   **User Presence:** See a list of all active users in the room.
-   **Full Drawing Toolkit:**
    -   Color Picker
    -   Adjustable Brush Size with Live Preview
    -   Eraser Tool
-   **History Management:** Unlimited Undo and Redo functionality.
-   **Fully Responsive:** Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones with touch support.
-   **Save Your Work:** Export the final canvas as a high-quality PNG, complete with watermark.
-   **Personalization:** Users can enter their name for a personalized experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## ü§ñ The Role of AI

As part of the #30DaysOfVibeCoding challenge, I'm transparent about how AI played a role. For this project.

-   **Debugging:** Acted as a rubber duck, helping identify logical errors like the mobile touch bug and the coordinate space issue.
-   **Boilerplate & SVGs:** Generated the initial server setup and the SVG icons for the UI, saving time to focus on core logic.
-   **Concept Explanation:** Provided explanations for complex topics like WebSocket rooms and canvas coordinate scaling.
